Communicating the value of blockchain TLDs to your customers can be complicated. We've compiled some resources and brand guidance in order to help you clearly convey the value of the .base and .faq TLDs on the Handshake blockchain. If you're looking for information about Handshake, or promotional materials specifically for these TLDs, you've come to the right place. We'll keep updating these materials to keep them current.

### Goals of the Handshake Project

"Names on the internet (top level domains, social networking handles, etc.) ultimately rely upon centralized actors with full control over a system which are relied upon to be honest, as they are vulnerable to hacking, censorship, and corruption. Handshake aims to experiment with new ways the internet can be more secure, resilient, and socially useful with a peer-to-peer system validated by the network's participants."

### Code

There are multiple <a href="https://github.com/handshake-org">github repos</a> that house code essential to a functional Handshake peer-to-peer network. These open source repoositories make Handshake completely opt-in. In order to particpate in the network, simply download the code and run the software.

Handshake domain owners have assurances that ICANN can never give that their assets are rooted in the Handshake blockchain, allowing public verification of security.
