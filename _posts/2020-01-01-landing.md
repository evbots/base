We've compiled some resources and brand guidance in order to help you clearly convey the value of the .base TLD on the handshake blockchain. If you're looking for information about Handshake, or promotional materials specifically for .base TLD, you've come to the right place. We'll keep updating these materials to keep them current.

## .base TLD Brand Guidance

### Tagline

".base - your secure home base on the new internet."

### Example Marketing Copy

#### Blurb:

The internet is changing. People are starting to realize how fragile the existing internet ecosystem is. Censorship is becoming more prevalent as corporations crack down on free speech in order to protect their own financial interests. The .base TLD is rooted in the Handshake blockchain: a truly permissionless solution that is completely independent of corporations and governments. Use .base to share your content with the world and stake your claim on the new internet.

#### Example Tweet:

"Register a .base TLD to stake your claim on the new internet powered by blockchain! #NewInternet"

## Handshake Blockchain

### Goals of the Handshake Project

"Names on the internet (top level domains, social networking handles, etc.) ultimately rely upon centralized actors with full control over a system which are relied upon to be honest, as they are vulnerable to hacking, censorship, and corruption. Handshake aims to experiment with new ways the internet can be more secure, resilient, and socially useful with a peer-to-peer system validated by the network's participants."
